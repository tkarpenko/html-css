                        <p>In order to give you a good idea of the potential of the tunehog platform, we have a few suggestions for what features you should check out first. Please keep in mind that we're still in Beta. We will continue to update tunehog over the next few weeks, adding more and more content for you to enjoy.</p>
                        <p>You can search for specific artists or use our 'Sounds Like' function to find similar sounding new artists and tracks. Try searching for artists such as Coldplay and ACDC, and check out the results.</p>
                        <p>Although no paid 'Opportunities' have been added to our Sync service yet, we have produced some samples that will show you what these will look like.</p>

                        <p>Of course. There are a bunch of features that we're still working on. These will update as the Beta version of the platform evolves. Please find a short list below:</p>

                                    As Discovery's results depend on "Harry" (our artificial intelligence software), the more searches our users run, the more accurate the results will be. Over the next few weeks, you will notice that search results become more and more accurate.

                                    If you search by colour code, results will also start to change and improve over the next few weeks. "Harry" is still in the process of matching colour to the mood of each song.
